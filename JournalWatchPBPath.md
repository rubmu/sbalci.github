We have started Pancreatobilary Pathology Journal Watch:

<p><em>The Pancreatobiliary Pathology Society Journal Watch</em> for the articles on the pancreatobiliary pathology will be released every other month.</p>
<p>We are reviewing the journals to select the articles about pancreas, gallbladder and biliary system pathologies. Original research articles, case series and reviews in the surgical pathology, cytopathology, and molecular pathology as well as related fields (i.e. novel methods, database studies) are included.</p>
<p>We have created several categories for convenience; however, articles in each category are in no particular order.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://pbpath.org/journal-watch/"><strong><em>Current Issue here</em></strong></a>, and <a href="http://pbpath.org/journal-watch-upcoming-issue/"><strong><em>the draft of the Upcoming Issue here</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Older Issues will be collected under <a href="http://pbpath.org/journal-watch-archive/"><strong><em>the archive</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Please let us know your comments and suggestions. Please fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeD3Z9J6Y7eMmiyM12f_SfAmHUlykb1zxZcwO6lg7cebGYQIQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>the feedback form</em></strong></a>.</p>
